I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share my thoughts and experiences in software development, technology, and my professional journey.\nWhat You\u0026rsquo;ll Find Here # On this blog, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing:\nTechnical insights from my work in software development Project showcases and lessons learned Industry trends and emerging technologies Personal reflections on the tech industry About My Background # As a software engineer with experience 10+ years of experience, I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions and staying current with the latest technologies.\nA Recent Discovery: Claude and the Power of AI Assistance # I recently discovered Claude code, Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s AI assistant, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been absolutely fascinated by its capabilities, particularly the use of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and specialized agents. What started as curiosity quickly turned into genuine excitement about the potential of AI-assisted development.\nOne of my first pet projects with Claude was migrating my old Hugo personal website to this completely new website powered by Hugo and the Blowfish theme. What would have traditionally taken me several days to plan, implement, and polish took just a couple of hours with Claude\u0026rsquo;s assistance. The ability to leverage specialized agents for different aspects of the project - from frontend development to content creation - was incredibly impressive.\nThis experience has opened my eyes to how AI can augment human creativity and productivity without replacing the critical thinking and decision-making that developers bring to projects.\nStay tuned for more content, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or topics you\u0026rsquo;d like me to cover!\nThank you for visiting, and I hope you find the content valuable.\n","date":"2 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/first-post/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Welcome to My Blog","type":"posts"},{"content":" Experience Company Link Role Dates Location Sygnum Bank Senior Software Engineer 2024 - Present Zurich, Switzerland Wayfair Senior Software Engineer 2022-2024 Berlin, Germany Software Engineer II 2019-2022 Berlin, Germany Software Engineer 2018-2019 Berlin, Germany Uvinum Software Engineer 2016-2018 Barcelona, Spain Junior Software Engineer 2015-2016 Barcelona, Spain Education School Link Degree Dates Location La Salle URL High Performance Web Programming Master's 2015-2016 Barcelona, Spain Multimedia Engineering 2010-2015 Barcelona, Spain Certifications Organization Link Certification Dates Details Linux Foundation Kubernetes Administration (LFS458) Dec 2019 Container Orchestration Cisco CCNA1 Jun 2013 Network Fundamentals Languages Español 🇪🇸: Native English 🇺🇸: Full Professional Proficiency Deutsch 🇩🇪: Elementary Proficiency Schwiizerdütsch 🇨🇭: I can say Chuchichäschtli ","date":"2 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resume/","section":"Marcos Segovia","summary":"","title":"Resume","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
