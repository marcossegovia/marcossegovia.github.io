I build things that solve problems I've encountered or ideas I wanted to explore. Developer tools, SaaS experiments, proof of concepts. Some are open-source, some are just for learning.

Each project is a deep dive into a specific problem space. Some are production-ready, others are experiments. All of them fill a purpose and teach something worth sharing.
