- **Personal reflections** on the tech industry

## About My Background

As a software engineer with experience 10+ years of experience, I'm passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions and staying current with the latest technologies.

## A Recent Discovery: Claude and the Power of AI Assistance

I recently discovered Claude code, Anthropic's AI assistant, and I've been absolutely fascinated by its capabilities, particularly the use of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and specialized agents. What started as curiosity quickly turned into genuine excitement about the potential of AI-assisted development.

One of my first pet projects with Claude was migrating my old Hugo personal website to this completely new website powered by Hugo and the Blowfish theme. What would have traditionally taken me several days to plan, implement, and polish took just a couple of hours with Claude's assistance. The ability to leverage specialized agents for different aspects of the project - from frontend development to content creation - was incredibly impressive.

This experience has opened my eyes to how AI can augment human creativity and productivity without replacing the critical thinking and decision-making that developers bring to projects.

Stay tuned for more content, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or topics you'd like me to cover!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the content valuable.
