# Hi, I'm Marcos! 👋

I'm a software engineer from Spain, living in Switzerland. I build web applications, backend systems, and products that solve real problems.

I've been coding professionally for years, focusing on backend development and DevOps. I'm interested in modern web technologies to make developer workflows and environments more automated and efficient. I'm passionate about embracing the revolutionary potential of AI to build these automated tools, enabling faster product delivery, while also experimenting with new SaaS platforms and developer experience tools.

## What I build

My projects include open-source tools from personal frustrations, SaaS experiments, and proof-of-concepts. 

## This site

Here, I share my projects, technical insights, and lessons learned. You'll find honest stories of what worked and what didn't.
